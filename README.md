## How to use
On the website, you can see robot emoji which is clickable and on click, it will play the pre-chosen song for you or which is more satisfying you can go on [notes website](https://pianoletternotes.blogspot.com/) choose whatever song you like, copy notes, past them in the text area and it will play them.

And of course, you can just play via your keyboard.
